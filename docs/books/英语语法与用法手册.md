# 英语语法与用法手册

## 词性

名词、动词、形容词、副词、代词、连词、介词

名词前面通常可以加 the

动词都有时态，可以加 will 的是动词

形容词分限定词和描述性形容词

修饰动词的副词通常可以移动到句首，修饰形容词的副词不能移动，副词也能修饰副词，如 I eat dinner very quickly. 这里very修饰了quickly

代词分为人称代词、反身代词、不定代词、指示性代词四种
人称代词有 he, she, it, they 等
反身代词有 myself, ourselves, yourself, yourselves, himself, herself, itself, themselves. 
I smiled at myself. 反身代词一定要有先行词, 例句里的反身代词myself回指先行词 I
不定代词有 some, many, both, all, none 等, 容易与用作形容词的同一个词混淆, 注意不定代词是独立的, 如 People would like some.
指示代词有 this, that, these, those

连词有 for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so

介词有 by, to, with, about, over 等, 介词与宾语绑定形成介词短语

## 短语

所有短语都包含一个中心词，中心词决定短语的属性

### 名词短语

[The well-dressed young woman] glanced in the mirror.

### 同位语短语

同位语指一个跟在另一个名词或代词之后的名词，用于补充说明前面一个名词或代词

The police went to [his last address, an old hotel in Denver].

[A hopeless romantic, I] always want movies to have an happy ending.
当主语名词是一个代词时，要将同位语短语倒置

[The Greek poet Homer] was blind.
古希腊诗人荷马是盲人.
Homer是限定性同位语，限定性同位语不能省略

### 动词短语

系动词及其补语

Donald is funny.
系动词把补语关联回到主语，系动词后的补语必须回指和描述主语

Donald sounded happy.
谓语形容词：主语的补语是形容词
Bluto is a bully.
表语：主语的补语是名词短语

行为动词及其补语

Amy smiled.
没有补语，不及物动词

Santa fed the reindeer.
直接宾语作补语

She gave me an umbrella.
有一小部分的及物动词有两个宾语，间接宾语和直接宾语

名词作宾补
John got the kids some pizza.

Keep the room clean.
形容词作宾补

### 介词短语

如果一个名词和其相连的介词短语可以被一个第三人称代词代替，那这个介词短语一定是名词的修饰词

I hated the muggy summers in Florida.
用作形容词修饰名词

We went to a movie after dinner.
用作副词的介词短语

## 句子与分句

句子 = 独立分句 + （从句）

### 副词性从句

表示时间: after, as, as soon as, before, even before, even after, since, until, when, whenever, while
I had finished my popcorn [before the movie even started].
The theater gets really quiet [when the movie starts].

表示地点: everyplace, everywhere, where, wherever
we found broken glass [where the accident had occurred].
The lamb followed Mary [everywhere she went].

表示方式: as, as if, as though
They talked about use [as if we were not even there].
I parked the car [as though no thing had happened].

表示原因: as, because, inasmuch as, since, so that 
She needs the key [beacuse she had to lock up tonight].
We left game early [since it was getting pretty one-sided].

表示条件: if, on condition that, provided that, unless
I wouldn't do [that if I were you].
Fred will go to the meeting [unless you want to go yourself].

表示让步: although, even though, though
Fred will go th the meeting, [although he didn't want to].
We went to dinner, [even though none of us were very hungry].

### 形容词性从句

如果一个名词和紧跟的从句可以用一个第三人称代词替换，那这是形容词性从句
限制性从句用that, 非限制性从句用which
q: 如何区分限制性从句？
a: 限制性从句会限制所修饰的名词

who whom whose that which

She married a man [whom she had met at work].

只有在形容词性从句中作宾语的关系代词才能被省略, 如 whom, that, which
The woman (whom) you asked me about is my sister-in-law.
The car (that) I was driving got a flat tire. 

We were gald that you could come.
It is later than you think it is.
比较级形容词的连接词必须是 than

### 名词性从句

如果一个从句可以用it替换，那就是名词性从句

That is [what we wanted].

## 非谓语动词

如果一个名词和一个分词短语可以被一个代词替代，那这个分词短语就是用来修饰那个名词

## 书写完整的句子

完整的句子前加 I realize, 仍能保持句子完整; 片段前加 I realize 会不自然

1. 主语+谓语
2. 没有使用不当的引导词（从句）

## 主谓一致

复合主语用 it 还是 they 替代，决定谓语动词用复数还是单数
